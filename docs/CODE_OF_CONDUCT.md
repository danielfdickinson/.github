# Code of conduct for repositories owned by @@danielfdickinson

Because this is a personal set of repositories with only occasional chiming in
by others, it'd be silly to go all formal.

I shall endeavour to listen to any concerns about my behaviour, and expect the
same from you (and likewise in interactions between others who interact with or
through <https://github.com/danielfdickinson>).

I also expect of myself, and participants a proactive effort to 'behave well'
towards each other. If you need examples of what that means, there are plenty
of formal codes of conduct (for example the [Contributor
Covenant][contribconvenant]). You can also read [the opensource.guide
information on codes of conduct][opensourcecoc]

If there is a problem that you feel needs my attention, [please use my published
email address][dfdemail] and I will make an effort to learn more
about the situation, and take appropriate actions. (Also note that I may take
actions proactively if I become aware of a situation on my own).

Such actions may include seeking to communicate with all parties (in a case
that is not clear cut), temporarily or permanently lock discussion or comments,
or block one or more users (if needed) (for direct participants).

For an indirect participant (e.g. a sponsor) the steps taken would be taken in
conjunction with available solutions and applicable third parties (e.g. GitHub),
assuming of course simple communication is not enough.

If you are having problems with me, or feel I am not doing enough, and you are
unsatisfied by my efforts around them, please let me know. If the results are
unsatisfactory, you probably will need to contact GitHub Support as there is
this is the account of an individual not an organization, so there are no
organizational supports to draw on.
