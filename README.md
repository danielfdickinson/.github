|        File        | Status | Purpose | Notes |
|--------------------|--------|---------|-------|
| [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) | sparse | Expectations in interactions between myself, contributors, and collaborators | This can wait until participation is not so sparse |
| [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) | sparse | How others can contribute | Should really be per-repo, but this will serve until old but non-archived repositories get their own file |
| FUNDING.yml | not present | Display a sponsor button with information of funding options for my open source projects | Need to research funding options first |
| [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) | sparse | Instructions for how to report a security vulnerability in a project | Just my public email for now |
| [SUPPORT.md](docs/SUPPORT.md) | sparse | How to get help with my projects | Mostly Discussions for now |

### Issue and pull request templates and configuration

Not present, yet. Given the variety of repositories I have, this probably needs
to be managed per-repo.
